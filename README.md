The 4-bit ALU uses an IC 7483N for addition and subtraction, and 4-to-1 multiplexers (MUX_4TO1) for operation selection, supporting addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR. The adder handles the subtraction using the carry input and XOR gates. Logical gates generate AND, OR, and XOR outputs. Multiplexers select between operations based on the select lines (S1, S0): 00 for addition and subtraction decided by the carry input, 01 for AND, 10 for OR, and 11 for XOR. Input operands (A and B) are provided bitwise like A4 A3 A2 A1 and B4 B3 B2 B1 via the interactive digital switches, and the output is displayed on a 7-segment display through a DCD Hex display.
